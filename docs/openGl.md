## OpenGL

- `OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)` is a widely-used cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- It provides a standard interface for interacting with a computer's graphics hardware to produce high-quality graphics in applications such as games, simulations, and CAD software.
- OpenGL is designed to be highly portable and is used across a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.

### Key Features of OpenGL

- `Cross-Platform`: OpenGL is supported on various operating systems, making it highly portable.
- `Hardware Acceleration`: It leverages the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) for rendering, which allows for high-performance graphics processing.
- `Extensible`: OpenGL has a robust set of extensions that allow developers to use the latest graphics features provided by hardware vendors.
- `Wide Adoption`: Due to its wide adoption, there is extensive documentation and community support available.

### Components of OpenGL

- `OpenGL Core`: The basic set of features provided by the OpenGL specification.
- `GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)`: A C-like language used to write shaders that run on the GPU, enabling advanced graphics effects.
- `Extensions`: Additional features provided by hardware vendors that extend the capabilities of OpenGL beyond its core specification.

### Basic Workflow in OpenGL

- `Context Creation`: Setting up an OpenGL context within a windowing system.
- `Shader Compilation`: Writing and compiling vertex and fragment shaders in GLSL.
- `Buffer Management`: Creating and managing buffers (like vertex buffers) that store vertex data.
- `Rendering`: Drawing graphics by issuing draw calls to the GPU.
- Typically used for desktop applications, games, simulations, and professional graphics applications.
- Runs on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, and others.
