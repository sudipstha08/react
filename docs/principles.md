## SOLID

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  A component should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job.

- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
